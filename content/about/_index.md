# Our Story

We're Mark and Valarie, and this is **Next Mountain Overland** - our journey into the next phase of life.

## The Second Mountain

The name "NextMtn" comes from David Brooks' book *The Second Mountain*. After successful careers, we decided to climb our "second mountain" - a life focused on adventure, connection, and experiences rather than achievement and accumulation.

- **Mark** retired at 51
- **Valarie** retired at 49

## Our Home on Wheels

**NextMtn** is our F-550-based RV, our home base for exploring North America. From our basecamp in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, we venture out to discover new places, meet interesting people, and live the adventure we've been dreaming about.

## The 2027 Vision

In 2027, we're embarking on our biggest adventure yet: riding adventure motorcycles from Colorado to the southern tip of Argentina via the Pan American Highway.

**The catch?** We don't even own motorcycles yet!

This site documents our preparation journey:
- Learning to ride adventure motorcycles
- Acquiring the right bikes and gear
- Building skills and confidence
- Planning the route and logistics
- And of course, our current travels in NextMtn

## Why We're Sharing

We believe in the open web and the power of sharing experiences. If our journey inspires you, helps you plan your own adventure, or simply entertains you on a quiet evening, then we've succeeded.
