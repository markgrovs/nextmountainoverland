Welcome to **Next Mountain Overland**!

This is the beginning of documenting our journey - both the one we're on now in our F-550 RV (NextMtn) and the one we're preparing for: riding adventure motorcycles from Colorado to Argentina in 2027.

## Why This Site?

As we travel through Baja Mexico right now, we realized we wanted a better way to share our experiences than just social media. We wanted:

- **A permanent home** for our stories and photos
- **Control over our content** (hello, open web!)
- **A way to document** our 2027 Pan American Highway preparation
- **A resource** for others planning similar adventures

## What to Expect

This site will evolve as we do. You'll find:

- **Travel logs** from our current adventures in NextMtn
- **Preparation updates** as we work toward our 2027 motorcycle journey
- **Lessons learned** about RV life, travel, and adventure
- **Photos** - lots of photos!
- **Honest reflections** on early retirement and the "second mountain"

## The 2027 Challenge

Here's the ambitious part: In 2027, we're planning to ride adventure motorcycles from our home in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, all the way to the southern tip of Argentina via the Pan American Highway.

**Current status:**
- ‚úÖ Have the dream
- ‚úÖ Have the commitment
- ‚ùå Don't have motorcycles
- ‚ùå Don't have motorcycle licenses
- ‚ùå Don't have experience with long-distance motorcycle travel

This site will document the entire preparation journey. Every step, every lesson, every mistake.
