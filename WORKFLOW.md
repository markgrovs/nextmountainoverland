# Content Creation Workflow

## Writing from the Road

### Mobile-First Approach

Since you'll be traveling, here's a workflow that works from anywhere:

#### Option 1: Direct GitHub Editing (Simplest)

1. Go to your GitHub repository on mobile
2. Navigate to `content/posts/`
3. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
4. Name it: `2025-10-04-post-title.md`
5. Write your post in markdown
6. Commit directly to main
7. Netlify auto-deploys in ~2 minutes

**Pros:** Works anywhere with internet, no apps needed
**Cons:** Limited editing features, need internet

#### Option 2: Text Editor + Git (Recommended)

**Apps you'll need:**
- **iA Writer** or **1Writer** (iOS) - Markdown editors with folder sync
- **Working Copy** (iOS) - Git client for iOS

**Workflow:**
1. Write post in iA Writer (syncs to iCloud)
2. Open Working Copy
3. Pull latest changes
4. Copy post from iCloud to repo
5. Commit and push
6. Auto-deploys!

#### Option 3: Obsidian (If you use it)

1. Set up Obsidian vault in your repo's `content/` folder
2. Write posts in Obsidian
3. Use Obsidian Git plugin to sync
4. Auto-deploys on push

### Desktop Workflow

```bash
# Start writing
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md

# Preview locally
hugo server -D

# When ready, publish
# (change draft: false in front matter)

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "New post: My New Post"
git push

# Automatically deploys!
```

```

## Batch Content Creation

2. **Upload all images** at once
3. **Schedule publishing** by setting future dates
4. **Queue commits** for different days

## Emergency "Quick Post" Workflow

When you're short on time:

```markdown
